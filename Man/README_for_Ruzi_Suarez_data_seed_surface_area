Surface area of Zanthoxylum ekmanii seeds that were or were not damaged. These seeds either presumably never came into contact with ants or were collected from Ectatomma ruidum colonies. Used to determine whether Ectatomma ruidum workers damage Zanthoxylum ekmanii seeds.

1. Number of variables: 16
2. Number of cases/rows: 77
3. Variable List: 
Seed_species: the seed species. In this case only Zanthoxylum ekmanii
file_name: the name of the associated image of the seed
Control_Colony: whether the seed was a control (i.e. presumably has never interacted with ants) or what colony the seed was retrieved from
groupID: the replicate number. Resets between the two treatments
Chamber: what chamber the seed was retrieved from if retrieved from a colony or "control" if not retrieved from a colony
total_SA: the total surface area of the seed in the image
Darea_1: first damaged surface area measured on the seed
D_area2: second damaged surface area measured on the seed
D_area3: third damaged surface area measured on the seed
D_area4: fourth damaged surface area measured on the seed
D_area5: fifth damaged surface area measured on the seed
Included_good_areas: any non-damaged surface areas located within the dramaged areas on the seed
Sum_damage: sum of all the damaged surface areas on the seed
Seed_damage_percent: percentage of the total surface area of the seed that has been damaged

notes2: some additional notes by SAR
