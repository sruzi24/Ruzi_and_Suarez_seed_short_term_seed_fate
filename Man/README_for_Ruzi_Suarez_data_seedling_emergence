Data on how many seedlings per replicate were able to emerge from their burial depth, whether the soil was sterilized, and the mass of the soil buried in.

1. Number of variables: 8
2. Number of cases/rows: 38
3. Variable List: 
Depth_cm: the depth the seeds were buried at for this replicate
Replicate: which replicate number this burial depth is
Num_seeds_buried: the number of seeds buried at this depth for this replicate
Num_seeds_emerged: the number of seedlings that were able to emerge at this depth for this replicate
Prop_emerged: the proportion of seedlings emerged to those placed
Mass_soil: the mass of the soil added to the clear tube not including the mass of the tube itself
Soil_autoclaved: whether the soil was sterilized or not
Holes: whether the tube had some pin holes punctured into it
