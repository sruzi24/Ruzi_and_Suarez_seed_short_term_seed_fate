## Describing the number of Zanthoylum ekmanii seeds moved by Ectatomma ruidum,
## how far they are moved, where they are taken, and if the dispersal distance is
## great enough to deposit the seed outside of the tree crown.

## RQ1: Do E. ruidum workers conduct directed dispersal depositing seeds in their
## colonies at distances that are biologically relevant (i.e. potentially far enough
## away to escape negative density dependent drivers of mortality)?
